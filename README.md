# Autonomous Astronomical Image Classifier

## Description

The Autonomous Astronomical Image Classifier is a Python-based AI project that automates the classification of astronomical images. The program utilizes web scraping techniques to gather the latest astronomical images from various online sources, such as NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD). It then preprocesses and augments the images, trains a deep learning model using convolutional neural networks, and classifies the images based on their astronomical content.

## Tasks Automated

1. **Web Scraping**: The program uses libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape websites and retrieve the latest astronomical images without requiring local files. It collects images from sources like NASA's APOD, ensuring that users can access up-to-date data.

2. **Image Preprocessing**: The program preprocesses the downloaded astronomical images to enhance the visibility of significant features. Tasks performed during preprocessing include resizing, normalizing, and applying filters to improve the image quality and facilitate accurate classification.

3. **Data Augmentation**: To increase the diversity of the training dataset, the program utilizes image transformation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming. This process generates augmented versions of the downloaded images, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving the model's generalization capabilities.

4. **Deep Learning Model Training**: The program leverages popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch to train a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is trained using the preprocessed and augmented dataset, learning to classify images into categories such as galaxies, planets, stars, or nebulae. The use of deep learning models ensures accurate classification and the ability to handle complex astronomical patterns.

5. **Model Evaluation and Optimization**: The program evaluates the performance of the trained model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide valuable insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses, enabling researchers to identify areas for improvement and optimization.

6. **Inference and Image Classification**: Once the model is trained, the program can classify new, unseen astronomical images based on their content. Researchers can provide the program with a new image, and it will identify celestial objects and classify them into predefined categories. The program also provides confidence scores, indicating the certainty of the classification result.

7. **Anomaly Detection**: The program includes anomaly detection capabilities, allowing it to identify and flag unusual or unexpected astronomical phenomena. It achieves this by comparing incoming images with previously seen patterns, alerting researchers to potential new discoveries or phenomena.

## Benefits

1. **Automation**: The Autonomous Astronomical Image Classifier automates the entire process of gathering astronomical images, preprocessing them, training a deep learning model, and classifying new images. It saves researchers valuable time and effort that would otherwise be spent on manual tasks.

2. **Efficiency**: By automating the preprocessing steps, model training, and image classification, researchers can work more efficiently. They can focus on analyzing the classified images and drawing scientific conclusions, rather than spending time on repetitive data processing tasks.

3. **Discovery of New Phenomena**: The anomaly detection capabilities of the program enable researchers to identify unexplained or unexpected celestial events. By flagging unusual patterns, the program can lead to groundbreaking discoveries and further research avenues. It acts as a powerful tool to assist astronomers in exploring the vastness of the universe.

4. **Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing**: The program facilitates collaboration among researchers by providing insights and classifying astronomical images. It becomes a shared resource that fosters interdisciplinary studies in astrophysics, enabling scientists from different domains to collaborate and exchange knowledge.

5. **Reduced Dependency on Local Files**: The program relies on web scraping techniques and downloadable data sources, eliminating the need for users to manage large local files on their own machines. This reduces storage requirements and makes it easier to access the latest astronomical images without worrying about local file management.

## Potential Extensions

1. **Real-time Image Classification**: Enhance the program to retrieve and classify astronomical images in real-time. This extension would allow researchers to monitor ongoing phenomena, receive immediate alerts for anomalies, and make time-sensitive observations.

2. **Multi-label Classification**: Extend the program to handle multi-label classification. In addition to single-label categorization, this extension would enable the identification of more complex astronomical configurations or events involving multiple objects or phenomena.

3. **Interactive Visualization**: Develop interactive visualizations or a web-based interface to explore and interact with the classified images. This extension would facilitate data exploration and interpretation, allowing researchers to delve deeper into the classified images and gain a better understanding of celestial phenomena.

4. **Collaborative Dataset Creation**: Enable the program to collaborate with other instances of the tool to create a shared dataset. Researchers could contribute to a diverse range of astronomical images collected by multiple users, fostering collaborative efforts and expanding the overall dataset's scope.
